# Dual_axis_solar_tracker
        üå≥A project based on sustainable development and energy efficiency.

A Dual Axis Solar Tracker system designed to follow the sun throughout the day to maximize solar panel efficiency. This project helps improve the energy output by automatically adjusting the panel's position based on sunlight direction using sensors and motor mechanisms.

## üìå Features

- Tracks the sun's position both **horizontally** and **vertically**
- Uses **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** sensors for sunlight detection
- Controlled using a **microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino/ESP32)
- **Servo motors** for movement
- Low-cost and scalable hardware design
